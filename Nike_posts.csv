Working on a lineup of Protros like these is a privilege because I get to be part of a team that encourages players to bring Mamba Mentality into their lives, whether they watched him play or not.

"NikeNike As a young girl attending a Native American boarding school on the Cherokee Nation Reservation in Oklahoma, Dr.Christine Panther remembers being taught the cultural practice of rising before dawn to greet the sun. That daily reverence toward the natural world helped inspire Panther, whose origins trace back to Oklahoma‚Äôs Kiowa, Quapaw and Shawnee Nations, to take up running throughout high school and into her adulthood. Many Indigenous communities across the world share the same sentiment: Nature can be a conduit to movement, which, in turn, is a conduit for change. ‚ÄúIndigenous communities across the world honor nature through movement and sport,‚Äù says Panther, a Sr. Manager, Social & Community Impact (SCI) at Nike. ‚ÄúSport is medicine.

Watching these groups use the power of sport to change lives for the better is a privilege, says Panther.

"NikeNike Growing up in a single-parent, immigrant household, Zainee Gafoor didn‚Äôt have access to a lot of sport- and play-based programs, or the lifelong benefits she knows would have come along with them.  Now, as a mom of two young kids and a Retail Operations Manager supporting Nike-owned stores throughout Canada, she‚Äôs determined to help expand sport for the next generation and give all kids, including her own, an opportunity to play.  ‚ÄúIf we think about our mission statement of bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete, that has to include the young and emerging athletes, and it has to include young and emerging athletes who are underserved,‚Äù says Zainee, a 13-year Nike employee, who also serves on the leadership committee for Nike‚Äôs ASCEND Network.  So when the opportunity to join Toronto‚Äôs Nike Community Impact Fund (NCIF) Employee Grant Selection Committee arose, Zainee jumped at the chance. The NCIF program trains each committee member on how to assess grant applications, so they can then share their local insights to decide which community organizations should receive funding.  ‚ÄúJust knowing we can make a real impact on our community as individuals and as an organization is so rewarding,‚Äù says Zainee. ‚ÄúAnd being part of the NCIF grant selection process allowed me to learn about different local organizations and the work they do.‚Äù  One that really stood out to her was Trails Youth Initiatives, which was ultimately selected for a grant. ‚ÄúI like that it brings kids to outdoor spaces, opening them up to experiences in nature like hiking or snowshoeing ‚Äî and showing them that there‚Äôs so much more out in the world to see.‚Äù  Check out our most recent NCIF grant recipients in Toronto and across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan: https://lnkd.in/eFqiD3YVhashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#NikeCommunityImpactFund",Image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQFEahp2xCcS1g/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1726156639980?e=1749081600&v=beta&t=c1k9BtFV-Sot5SoPDpAkcev_l5J8qbhUAva0sMz4nCk,,0,0,20,0,0,20
