"NikeNike Hello, 2025. Let's get to work. 💪  Relentless determination and hunger for a challenge is the ethos behind Nike’s Year of the Mamba collection. Featuring Kobe Protro models V, VI and IX, the collection is designed with the obsessive attention to detail that was the cornerstone to Kobe Bryant’s career. Kobe product is synonymous with putting in the work while everyone else rests. When a shoe is linked to a mindset, says Bronson Yim, Kobe Footwear Product Line Manager, you have a product that stands the test of time. “A product becomes something more when it draws an emotion out of you,” says Yim. “Wearing Kobe product is about expecting the highest standards for yourself and what you can accomplish. Working on a lineup of Protros like these is a privilege because I get to be part of a team that encourages players to bring Mamba Mentality into their lives, whether they watched him play or not. If a player puts on some Kobes, the question we try to answer is, ‘What should they feel when they lace up and get to work?’” Learn more about Nike’s Year of the Mamba Collection: https://lnkd.in/gXBTad5xhashtag#NikeBasketball hashtag#Kobe hashtag#JustDoIt",Image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHJDn2FR1NJZQ/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZRwPUBqHsAg-/0/1737049851296?e=1749081600&v=beta&t=WOAXHsn9Lhe2g6oKKlb6c47CXtqS58tQ4FZSBiLFxvc,,0,0,114,0,0,114
"NikeNike “There are still so many stigmas around motherhood, especially through the lens of sport,” says Fanny Yung Ho, Nike Senior Manager, Design Innovation.  “Our team asked ourselves, how do we break down those barriers? How do we celebrate motherhood more?” The answer: the Nike (M) Swoosh Bra — the brand’s first nursing sports bra that’s compatible with wearable breast pumps, allowing mothers to unlock movement without compromising comfort or support. The bra has proprietary Nike hardware that helps ensure the clips stand up to lunges and burpees while pumping, along with offering easy access for nursing and adjustability for up to two full cup sizes. “With this bra, we want to empower women to say, ‘Here I am — I’m pumping, I’m moving, I’m proud to be a mom, I’m proud to be an athlete, and I can be both at the same time,'” says Ho.

"NikeNike Too often, when breastfeeding moms return to work, they find themselves pumping in spaces that feel like an afterthought. For Nike, working moms are a priority. It’s why, at our European Logistics Campus (ELC) in Belgium, we’ve reimagined our mothers’ rooms with thoughtful renovations to create calm, comfortable spaces where nursing moms feel fully supported.  “As a breastfeeding mom myself, this has been empowering in so many ways,” says Nike employee Kaat Clerix, who led the renovation project. “These rooms make work-life integration more feasible. They’ve helped me be successful in both my personal and professional life. It feels inclusive and fosters my sense of belonging.” Purposefully designed with comfortable furniture, a wash sink, relaxing music, towels, a fridge for milk storage — there’s even a spot to hang birth announcements — these spaces are built to help working moms feel cared for and empowered. “Becoming a mom is one of the most life-changing events a woman will experience,” Clerix says. “When your employer shows awareness and investment in your well-being as a mom, it makes you feel respected and supported.

"NikeNike It was a window into the future. On December 7, more than 400 of the country’s best distance runners traveled to Portland, Ore., for the Nike Cross Nationals (NXN) Finals. NXN is the pinnacle high school cross-country showcase in the United States, and individual runners and clubs from eight regional championships went head to head, leaving it all on the course to be crowned National Champion. Many of the top finishers of NXN grow into accomplished pro runners, winning national championships, international medals — even Olympic gold. In the middle of the action that weekend was Cameron “Cam” Yates, Brand Manager, North America, Nike Running. He says that his team gets to “bring high school running to life in the United States,” and they cut no corners in making NXN the most thrilling race experience possible for the competitors, right down to the color of the course markers and the graphic treatment of the finish line. “I found running later in my life,” says Cam, who grew up playing baseball and soccer. “After putting on meets like this, I get to see how supportive the running community is toward each other. You especially see that during NXN, with how the pros travel here on race day to encourage the high school runners. For these high school kids, a big part of their experience is shaped by seeing these accomplished runners who they admire, and who’ve competed in this race themselves, cheering them on. They’ll remember it for the rest of their lives.

"NikeNike Marisa Smith started at Nike as a seasonal retail employee. Last week, she stood on a much bigger stage — emceeing the Women of Nike (WON) Fashion Show at Nike World Headquarters.Her journey from a retail store associate to a Nike EKIN — that’s Nike spelled backward, because these brand storytellers know the company backward and forward — wasn’t a straight path. The Texas native worked at five different stores before taking a leap with Nike’s Track Stretch Program, a six-month initiative that gives retail employees the opportunity to work at WHQ. Following that, she landed a permanent role training store teams in Dallas.No matter where she’s been, one thing has stayed the same: the power of the Nike community.“I wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for the people — my mentors, my teammates, the leaders who reminded me to keep going when things got tough,” she says. “That’s the magic of Nike. We push each other forward.”That same energy was on display as she took the mic at the WON show, calling out names while women of all backgrounds, body types and career paths took the stage. Together, they celebrated identity, empowerment and growth — a message that resonates deeply with Smith.“This wasn’t just about fashion,” she says. “It was about celebrating who we are, where we’ve come from and where we’re going.”The show’s theme — honoring your legacy and blooming into who you’re meant to be — felt personal to her.“When I started in retail, I was just looking for a job to get me through college; I never imagined it would turn into this. As soon as I saw last year’s show, I knew I had to be a part of it,” she says. “The energy was just unmatched. The women. The atmosphere. The celebration of our stories. It’s why I love working here.”The excitement reminded her of the first time she visited WHQ.“The moment I stepped on campus for the first time, I knew — this is where I belong.”Learn more about Nike’s Track Stretch Program: https://lnkd.in/gcUcRgQbhashtag#WomenOfNike hashtag#WONFashionShow hashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#JustDoItPC: Dascha O., Aeri Kim, Mike Esparza, Pauline Zonneveld and Nelly M.

The business conference highlights the economic influence of the nation’s Latino population, giving attendees the chance to connect with the broader Latino talent community. Nike’s presence at L’ATTITUDE made a big impression on Camila. As co-chair of Nike’s Latino and Friends Employee Network, she helps invite teammates across the company to engage with, learn from and better understand Latino culture. Showing up at L’ATTITUDE, she says, reflects the company’s values to be at the forefront of these community-led events and conferences.For Camila, one of the event’s highlights was hearing from Doug Bowles, Nike VP/GM of Nike LatAm, who was one of L’ATTITUDE’s keynote speakers. Bowles used the brand’s recent marathon campaign in Mexico City as a case study for Nike’s investment to serve runners across Latin America. “When he was talking about the energy and excitement around running in Mexico City, I got chills,” says Camila. “It made me feel so inspired and connected to the brand.

"NikeNike As a young girl attending a Native American boarding school on the Cherokee Nation Reservation in Oklahoma, Dr.Christine Panther remembers being taught the cultural practice of rising before dawn to greet the sun. That daily reverence toward the natural world helped inspire Panther, whose origins trace back to Oklahoma’s Kiowa, Quapaw and Shawnee Nations, to take up running throughout high school and into her adulthood. Many Indigenous communities across the world share the same sentiment: Nature can be a conduit to movement, which, in turn, is a conduit for change. “Indigenous communities across the world honor nature through movement and sport,” says Panther, a Sr. Manager, Social & Community Impact (SCI) at Nike. “Sport is medicine. Sport opens up a world of possibilities outside our door, especially for our young people. That’s why the N7 Fund’s connection to movement and sport is so vital, and so transformative.” Among Panther’s responsibilities within SCI is to help facilitate the N7 Fund application process, which is now open through January 6. The program recognizes nonprofits at all scales, from grassroots to the national level, that are increasing access to sport for Indigenous youth across North America. Watching these groups use the power of sport to change lives for the better is a privilege, says Panther. Her work at Nike, she says, places her within a proud lineage of Indigenous leaders and organizations, past and present, who see movement as a pathway toward transformation.  “The N7 Fund follows the proverbial wisdom of Indigenous communities to consider the impact of our choices on the seventh generation,” says Panther. “The children from this and future generations are benefitting from the tireless work of our partners, which the fund helps support. Getting a front-row seat to see how they will change the world is an honor.” Learn more about the N7 Fund and apply at https://lnkd.in/g-BSm_4Bhashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#NikeN7Fund hashtag#JustDoIt",Image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHOf_E3NuU1Sw/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1731014898043?e=1749081600&v=beta&t=vxmsCKBGoOTtaYRQzRV5yHpb7dvF4KokNSkFX-AYLUE,,0,0,35,0,0,35

She is the first athlete to complete this triple feat since Czech runner Emil Zátopek swept gold in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.“When running, sometimes I feel good…and sometimes I feel bad and feel like I can’t continue,” says the 31-year-old Dutch athlete. “Life is the same way, and that’s what makes life beautiful, the way it goes up and down.” As of late July, the versatile runner ranked as the 22nd-fastest woman in the 1,500 meter, seventh-fastest in the 5,000 meter, ninth-fastest in the 10,000 meter and second-fastest in the marathon.In 2021, she became the only athlete in Olympic history to medal in the 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000 meter events at the same Olympics Games.

"NikeNike When Christopher Hicks was in the first grade, he had zero interest in playing baseball.But one persistent voice — Coach Walter at the local Boys & Girls Club — convinced him to step onto the diamond anyway, igniting a lifelong love for sport.Now, many years later, he’s giving back in the same way his coach did. As Senior Manager on Nike’s Social & Community Impact team, Chris helps power programs like the Nike Mamba League, giving kids from underserved LA communities the chance to learn, grow and thrive through basketball.Hicks’ love for basketball started early. “Growing up, sport was a safe space where I could be free,” he says. “Basketball gave me comfort, security and confidence, allowing me to push my own limits and unlock my potential.”After college, Hicks coached at the Kobe Bryant Basketball Academy where he saw firsthand how impactful the “Mamba Mentality” was for kids. Those experiences set him up for an incredible full-circle moment nearly 10 years later during his first Nike project: expanding the Mamba League throughout Los Angeles. And on his initial site visit to the Boys & Girls Club of Wilmington, guess who opened the door? Coach Walter, still supporting local youth as the club’s transportation director.“I recognized him immediately,” Hicks says. “Seeing his continued commitment to the community after all these years was inspiring.”Like Coach Walter’s dedication, the Mamba League is rooted in Kobe’s vision: empowering young athletes through inclusive coaching, equal playing time, age-appropriate equipment and at least 50% girls participation.“That’s what it’s all about for me,” Hicks says. “Through Mamba League, we get to spark joy for kids across L.A. and keep them in the game.”Read more about how Nike is powering the future of youth sport: https://lnkd.in/gSXe6AsChashtag#MambaLeague hashtag#NikeImpact hashtag#FutureOfSport hashtag#JustDoIt",Image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFvv6Kuz2uj5g/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZYhA9jvGUAg-/0/1744310623467?e=1749081600&v=beta&t=NjJryzt-mYCCIoGPPTJBrUrsiPmnAaEif4nDTsnj5UY,,0,0,31,0,0,31

"NikeNike As Nike’s longest-tenured employee on the Social & Community Impact team — 47 years with the Swoosh and counting! — Kathy Webb, Nike Employee Community Engagement Director, knows a thing or two about legacy. In 2007, she and her team established a long-time partnership with Special Olympics Oregon (SOOR), creating the Nike Youth Games which invited kids with intellectual disabilities to world headquarters to experience a team sport for the first time. “This never-been-done-before youth event brought potential Oregon Special Olympics athletes and their families face-to-face with SOOR staff and Nike volunteers where they learned the basics of track, soccer, bocce and basketball — a first step into SOOR’s youth sports programs,” Webb says. And it worked. Sixteen years later, SOOR has achieved its goal of building statewide awareness of its youth programs and creating a pipeline of youth participants ready to benefit from its sports programs. Now, they’ve asked Nike to help them tackle a new goal, one that happens to coincide with the next phase of life for many of SOOR’s youth participants — high school. Nike is making a three-year, $300,000 investment that will expand SOOR’s Unified Sports® Program, which pairs Special Olympics athletes and partners as teammates for training and competition. Together, SOOR and Nike will co-host coaching clinics for basketball, soccer and track & field at Nike’s world headquarters, open to both the community and Nike employee volunteers. The first basketball clinic was held last month, with more planned for spring. “There’s simply no better partner to make sure kids with intellectual disabilities have the access and quality coaching they deserve as they unite in play with their peers,” says Webb. “It’s what SOOR calls ‘inclusion revolution,’ and it brings out the best in all of us.” Check out more ways we support programs like SOOR: https://lnkd.in/gZSvXqqhhashtag#NikeCommunityImpact, hashtag#SpecialOlympics, hashtag#UnifiedSports, hashtag#JustDoIt",Image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHhhr_LTCkq2Q/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZSuBwcWHEAo-/0/1738086484133?e=1749081600&v=beta&t=XdROH-BHjmKRUOx7fV3MK4xuaHUd8T8o3zZW-n_nq-M,,0,0,29,0,0,29

"NikeNike When Nike’s employee networks mobilize around a cause, they create change that ripples from the inside out.That concept is nothing new for Taya Saxton, a Director of Cross Functional Sustainability at Nike. Taya served over four years in the Air Force, and she’s worked at Nike for almost a decade now, helping lead the company’s supply chain strategy to become more environmentally responsible. As a member of the leadership team on Nike’s Military Veterans and Friends Network (NMV), Saxton and her colleagues saw another opportunity to spearhead: helping shape a paid leave program for Nike’s military employees.“A consistent trait among our military friends is the resolve to find a way, even if you don’t know something,” says Taya. “When I was on active duty in the Air Force, I was immediately placed in an aerospace program. I knew nothing about satellites. But I didn’t have another option. I needed to hunker down and start learning. You find that commitment inside of every Nike military veteran.”The network drafted a detailed proposal for the leave program in 2017, eventually presenting to the company’s senior leadership. The support was resounding. A year later, Nike introduced its military leave program, giving employees who volunteer or are called back to the uniformed services up to 12 weeks of paid time off every 12 months.“The NMV really helped champion the program,” says Taya. “I love how our network gets to focus on showing up for the Nike military community at large, in addition to representing the military experience for all of our employees.”Learn more about how Nike supports the personal and professional well-being of our employees: https://lnkd.in/dpWnGc33hashtag#MemorialDay hashtag#NikeUnited hashtag#NMV hashtag#SwooshLife",Image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHXKv_hVetjag/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1716824763461?e=1749081600&v=beta&t=57HIRppIXNomyRxSfeCMid3my_cEMFpInUWeYk7wHos,,0,0,27,0,0,27

The NCIF program trains each committee member on how to assess grant applications, so they can then share their local insights to decide which community organizations should receive funding.  “Just knowing we can make a real impact on our community as individuals and as an organization is so rewarding,” says Zainee. “And being part of the NCIF grant selection process allowed me to learn about different local organizations and the work they do.”  One that really stood out to her was Trails Youth Initiatives, which was ultimately selected for a grant. “I like that it brings kids to outdoor spaces, opening them up to experiences in nature like hiking or snowshoeing — and showing them that there’s so much more out in the world to see.”  Check out our most recent NCIF grant recipients in Toronto and across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan: https://lnkd.in/eFqiD3YVhashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#NikeCommunityImpactFund",Image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQFEahp2xCcS1g/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1726156639980?e=1749081600&v=beta&t=c1k9BtFV-Sot5SoPDpAkcev_l5J8qbhUAva0sMz4nCk,,0,0,20,0,0,20
